# TacDes: Design Interface toward Ubiquitous Tactile Sensing
![alt text](./image/teaser.png)

### TacDes

TacDes is a web-based toolkit to streamline the design process of resistive tactile sensors for users at various expertise levels. By performing a formative study with experts and non-experts in tactile sensing, we identify motivations and workflows for tactile sensing interface design. With such insights, we create an open-sourced design toolkit, which facilitates the standardized design process with flexible asset management, automated sensor layout generation, ready-to-use templates, safety warning assistance, and layered exports. Future work will extend TacDes to 3D designs and evaluate its impact on fabrication and user experience.
